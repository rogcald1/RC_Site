<h1>Projects (Updated 2/11/2021)</h1>
<h4>These are the projects I've worked on in order to get a good understanding of different programming languages. Do they look pretty?
    Probably not. But it was important to me that they worked as intended and that the user has a good experience (no errors or confusion).
    These can always use more work to look and function like a "real" site or app.

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/RockPaperScissor/RPS%20with%20UI.html" targat="_blank">Rock Paper Scissor</a></li>
    <p>Super early project with JavaScript and HTML. First usage of JS to adjust DOM elements. Code can most likely be written
        better to not be as lengthy, but still works overall. </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/todolistproject/index.html" target="_blank">To Do List Project</a></li>
    <p>Mostly a JavaScript project, as well as a little HTML.</p>
    <p>I think for the most part, this one is fairly complete. Could always make more CSS design changes (and I may come back to it),
        but glad this works the way it should. </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/CalculatorProject/index.html" target="_blank">Calculator Project</a></li>
    <p>Also a JavaScript project and HTML</p>
    <p>To me, infinitely trickier than the to-do project, and can definitely improve upon not only how the calculator works,
        but the JS code itself. One existing issue that I'll also have to figure out is the "NaN" response if the result length is too long.
        Also worth looking into adding the functionality of hitting the keys instead of clicking on each number.
    </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/RecipeApp/" target="_blank">Recipe App</a></li>
    <p>Working with ReactJS this time, learning to call on an API. Tricky to put together but the hardest thing was finding
        the best API for this after I already started the project. Initial only had an "http://" version of their site, which 
        caused security issues. Ended up going through RapidAPI for the info needed. 
    </p>
    <p>Going to come back to this and add some formatting and design to it. Also need to add something to catch an issue
        with the API - seems to hit some errors occasionally.
    </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/WeatherApp/index.html" target="_blank"> Weather App</a></li>
    <p>More ReactJS with API work here. Slightly easier than the recipe app only because you only need two things from the user
        instead of a list of ingredients. API was also easier to work with in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>I think this is also wrapped up for the time being. At least with what the weather API is able to provide. It'd be great if
        the app wasn't dependent on lat/long but zip code instead, so that would require finding another API to help convert zip
        to what is needed. 
    </p>
