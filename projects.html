<h1>Projects (Updated 2/10/2021)</h1>
<div>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/todolistproject/index.html" target="_blank">To Do List Project</a></li>
    <p>Mostly a JavaScript project, as well as a little HTML.</p>
    <p>I think for the most part, this one is fairly complete. Could always make more CSS design changes (and I may come back to it),
        but glad this works the way it should. </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/CalculatorProject/index.html" target="_blank">Calculator Project</a></li>
    <p>Also a JavaScript project and HTML</p>
    <p>To me, infinitely trickier than the to-do project, and can definitely improve upon not only how the calculator works,
        but the JS code itself. One existing issue that I'll also have to figure out is the "NaN" response if the result length is too long
    </p>

    <li><a href="https://rogcald1.github.io/RecipeApp/" target="_blank">Recipe App</a></li>
    <p>Working with ReactJS this time, learning to call on an API. Tricky to put together but the hardest thing was finding
        the best API for this after I already started the project. Initial only had an "http://" version of their site, which 
        caused security issues. Ended up going through RapidAPI for the info needed. 
    </p>
    <p>Going to come back to this and add some formatting and design to it. Also need to add something to catch an issue
        with the API - seems to hit some errors occasionally.
    </p>
</ul>
